## Java 8+ Stream Operations Overview

### Introduction
This document provides an overview of key concepts and operations available in Java 8+ for Stream API and Collector API.

### Contents

1. **Java 8+ Key Features**
    - Streams API and Collectors API

2. **Common Operations: Map, Filter, Reduce**
    - Mapping, Filtering, and Reducing data
    - Example: Calculating the average age of users above 20

3. **Traditional Iterator Pattern**
    - Manual iteration through a list of users

4. **Stream vs. Non-Stream Approaches**
    - Comparison between stream and non-stream operations
    - Functional, declarative operations in streams

5. **Stream Characteristics**
    - Properties and behavior of streams
    - Intermediate and terminal operations

6. **Stream Creation and Types**
    - Generating and working with different types of streams

7. **Stream Operations: Intermediate & Terminal**
    - Intermediate and terminal operations available
    - Examples of each operation

8. **Java 9+ Features**
    - Enhancements in stream processing

9. **Collector API**
    - Collectors for aggregating stream elements
    - `toMap()` for transforming elements into a key-value map

10. **Optional Class**
    - Handling potentially absent values
    - Methods available in the `Optional` class

### Conclusion
This overview provides insights into stream processing, available methods, and best practices for utilizing the Stream API in Java.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `map()` | Applies a function to each element and returns a new stream of the results. |
| `filter()` | Filters elements based on a given predicate and returns a stream with only the matching elements. |
| `reduce()` | Aggregates elements to a single result by applying a binary operation. |
| `forEach()` | Performs an action on each element in the stream. |
| `count()` | Returns the count of elements in the stream. |
| `max()` | Finds the maximum element in the stream based on a comparator. |
| `min()` | Finds the minimum element in the stream based on a comparator. |
| `collect()` | Transforms the elements into a collection or other data structure. |
| `allMatch()` | Checks if all elements match a given predicate. |
| `anyMatch()` | Checks if any elements match a given predicate. |
| `noneMatch()` | Checks if no elements match a given predicate. |

## Functional Programming Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pure Functions | Functions that consistently produce the same output for the same input, without causing side effects. |
| Immutability | Data that cannot be changed once created; any modification creates a new copy. |
| Higher-order Functions | Functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results. |
| Lambda Expressions | Anonymous functions typically used to pass behavior as an argument. |
| Streams | A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. |
| Map / Filter / Reduce | Key functional programming operations to manipulate collections or sequences of data. |
| Optional | A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. |
| Predicate | A functional interface representing a boolean-valued function of one argument; often used for filtering. Example: `Predicate<Integer> isPositive = num -> num > 0;` |
| Function | A functional interface that accepts one argument and produces a result; used for transformation or mapping. Example: `Function<Integer, String> intToString = Object::toString;` |
| Consumer | A functional interface that accepts a single argument and performs an operation without returning any result. Example: `Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;` |
| BiConsumer | A functional interface that represents an operation accepting two input arguments and returns no result; often used for side effects. Example: `BiConsumer<String, Integer> printKeyValue = (key, value) -> System.out.println(key + ": " + value);` |
